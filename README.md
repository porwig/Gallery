# gallery
This is an AngularJS image gallery that includes search and pagination. It uses pagination code shared by MIchael Bromley (http://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/blog/108/paginate-almost-anything-in-angularjs).

Planned upgrades include:
 * Add SEF URL for each image
 * Add gallery categories
 * Add image tags
 * CRUD with MySQL
 * FOSS CMS integrations (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Grav)
