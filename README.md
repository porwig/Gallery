# gallery
This is an AngularJS image gallery that includes search and pagination. It uses Bootstrap 3 and pagination code shared by Michael Bromley (http://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/blog/108/paginate-almost-anything-in-angularjs).

Planned updates include:
 * Add SEF URLs for each image
 * Add gallery categories
 * Add image tags
 * Define variables for json path, # of thumbnails per page
 * Simplify pagination controls to Prev, Next
 * Clean up CSS (middle row thumbnail position, etc)
 * Change data source from json to MySQL
 * FOSS CMS integrations (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Grav)
